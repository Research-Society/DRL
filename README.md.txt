MATLAB Simulation for DRL-Based IRS-Assisted NOMA-ISAC Framework
Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code to simulate and evaluate the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-Based IRS-Assisted NOMA-ISAC Framework. The framework enhances spectrum efficiency and sensing accuracy in 6G wireless networks using Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques.

The code includes:

Simulation of the DRL-based optimization for IRS phase shifts and beamforming vectors.
Comparison of key performance metrics with traditional methods:
Spectral Efficiency (bps/Hz)
Sensing Accuracy (%)
Robustness in Dynamic Environments (%)
Power Consumption (mW)
Graphical representation of results for easy visualization.
Requirements
To run the MATLAB simulation, ensure you have the following:

MATLAB (R2020b or later)
Signal Processing Toolbox
Deep Learning Toolbox (for DRL integration)
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (optional for further ML enhancements)
